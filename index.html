3. Host Your Site:
You can use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to host your HTML file for free.
Follow the instructions on these platforms to deploy your index.html.
4. Collect and Review Responses:
Responses will be collected in the associated Google Sheets of your Google Form.
Review the responses to analyze the 3 key strengths and 3 key weaknesses.
This approach gives you a simple, anonymous way to collect feedback without the need for a backend server or database, as Google Forms handles the data collection and storage.
